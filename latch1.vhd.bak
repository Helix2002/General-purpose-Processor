Entity latch1 IS
	PORT (
		A : IN STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(7 DOWNTO 0); --8 nit A input
		Resetn, Clock : In STD_LOGIC; --1 bit clock input and 1 bit reset input bit
	Q : OUT STD_LOGIC_VECTOR(7 DOWNTO 0)); -- 8 bit output

End latch1;
Architecture Behavior OF latch1 IS
Begin
	Process (Resetn, Clock) -- Process takes reset and clock as inputs
	Begin
		If Resetn = '0' Then -- when reset input is '0' the latches does not operate
			Q <= "00000000";
		Elsif Clock'EVENT And Clock = '1' Then -- level sensitive based on clock
			Q <= A;
		End If;
	End Process;
End Behavior;
